        "notes": "Maximum Area of Longest Diagonal Rectangle\n\n          - Summary: The code uses a 2D integer array to represent the dimensions of rectangles. It iterates through each rectangle, calculating the square of its diagonal using the Pythagorean theorem.  It then updates the maximum diagonal and corresponding area if a larger diagonal is found or if the diagonals are equal but the area is larger. Finally, it returns the maximum area found.\n\n          - Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of rectangles. This is because the code iterates through the input array once.\n          - Space Complexity: O(1).

        "notes": "Length of Longest V-Shaped Diagonal Segment\n\n          - Summary: The code uses a 3D array `memo` for dynamic programming to store results of subproblems, a 2D array `grid` representing the input matrix, and an array `DIRS` to define diagonal directions.  It iterates through the grid, and for each cell with value 1, performs a depth-first search (`dfs`) to find the longest V-shaped diagonal segment starting from that cell. The `dfs` function explores different diagonal directions and turns, using memoization to avoid redundant computations. The algorithm returns the length of the longest V-shaped segment found.\n\n          - Time Complexity: O(mn*4^L), where m and n are the dimensions of the grid and L is the maximum length of a V-shaped diagonal segment. The time complexity is dominated by the `dfs` function, which explores at most 4 branches at each step in the worst-case.  The memoization helps to reduce the number of recursive calls.\n          - Space Complexity: O(mn*8), dominated by the 3D memoization array `memo`.

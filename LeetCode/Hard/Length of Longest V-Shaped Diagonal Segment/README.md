3459. Length of Longest V-Shaped Diagonal SegmentSolvedHardTopicsCompaniesHintYou are given a 2D integer matrix grid of size n x m, where each element is either 0, 1, or 2.

A V-shaped diagonal segment is defined as:


	The segment starts with 1.
	The subsequent elements follow this infinite sequence: 2, 0, 2, 0, ....
	The segment:
	
		Starts along a diagonal direction (top-left to bottom-right, bottom-right to top-left, top-right to bottom-left, or bottom-left to top-right).
		Continues the sequence in the same diagonal direction.
		Makes at most one clockwise 90-degree turn to another diagonal direction while maintaining the sequence.
	
	




Return the length of the longest V-shaped diagonal segment. If no valid segment exists, return 0.

Example 1:


Input: grid = [[2,2,1,2,2],[2,0,2,2,0],[2,0,1,1,0],[1,0,2,2,2],[2,0,0,2,2]]

Output: 5

Explanation:



The longest V-shaped diagonal segment has a length of 5 and follows these coordinates: (0,2) â†’ (1,3) â†’ (2,4), takes a 90-degree clockwise turn at (2,4), and continues as (3,3) â†’ (4,2).


Example 2:


Input: grid = [[2,2,2,2,2],[2,0,2,2,0],[2,0,1,1,0],[1,0,2,2,2],[2,0,0,2,2]]

Output: 4

Explanation:



The longest V-shaped diagonal segment has a length of 4 and follows these coordinates: (2,3) â†’ (3,2), takes a 90-degree clockwise turn at (3,2), and continues as (2,1) â†’ (1,0).


Example 3:


Input: grid = [[1,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,0],[2,0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,2,2],[2,0,0,2,0]]

Output: 5

Explanation:



The longest V-shaped diagonal segment has a length of 5 and follows these coordinates: (0,0) â†’ (1,1) â†’ (2,2) â†’ (3,3) â†’ (4,4).


Example 4:


Input: grid = [[1]]

Output: 1

Explanation:

The longest V-shaped diagonal segment has a length of 1 and follows these coordinates: (0,0).

Constraints:


	n == grid.length
	m == grid[i].length
	1 <= n, m <= 500
	grid[i][j] is either 0, 1 or 2.

Track the current position, direction of traversal, and whether a turn has already been made, and take transitions accordingly to find the longest V-shaped diagonal segment.Discussion (138)Choose a typeCommentðŸ’¡ Discussion Rules1.

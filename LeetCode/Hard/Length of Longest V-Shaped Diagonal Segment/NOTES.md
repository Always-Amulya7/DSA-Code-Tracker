          Length of Longest V-Shaped Diagonal Segment

          - Summary: The code uses a 3D array `memo` for dynamic programming to store results of subproblems, a 2D array `grid` representing the input matrix, and an array `DIRS` to define diagonal directions.  It iterates through the grid, and for each cell with value 1, performs a depth-first search (`dfs`) to find the longest V-shaped diagonal segment starting from that cell. The `dfs` function explores different diagonal directions and turns, using memoization to avoid redundant computations. The algorithm returns the length of the longest V-shaped segment found.

          - Time Complexity: O(mn*4^L), where m and n are the dimensions of the grid and L is the maximum length of a V-shaped diagonal segment. The time complexity is dominated by the `dfs` function, which explores at most 4 branches at each step in the worst-case.  The memoization helps to reduce the number of recursive calls.
          - Space Complexity: O(mn*8), dominated by the 3D memoization array `memo`. The array has dimensions m x n x 8, where 8 represents the number of possible states for `mask` (4 directions x 2 turn states).

13. Roman to IntegerSolvedEasyTopicsCompaniesHintRoman numerals are represented by seven different symbols:Â I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

For example,Â 2 is written as IIÂ in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written asÂ XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:


	I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.Â 
	X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.Â 
	C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.


Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

Â 
Example 1:

Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.


Example 2:

Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.


Example 3:

Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.


Â 
Constraints:


	1 <= s.length <= 15
	s contains onlyÂ the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
	It is guaranteedÂ that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].

A good solution is not the most efficient one but a balance between clean code / readability and performance. Being a one liner is not to be smart, it's having a ego two mountains tall.

I don't think anyone familiar with the law of roman numbers.Â Read more26813Derek PapierskiDec 17, 2022as a beginner, here are some python hints that might help other newbies start off in the right direction:

use a dictionary for the roman numeral values
use enumerate when iterating through the input string (i always forget to use this)
to distinguish "VI"=6, but "IV"=4, you need to see if the numeric value of the next character is greater than the numeric value of the current character

HOWEVER, LeetCode's answer is IL which is wrong according to references cited above. It is also wrong according to their own problem descritpion wherein thay stated:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.

Granted, the above description is vague enought that it does not explicity state that "I" cannot be placed before "L" or "C" but I think it can be assumed.Â Read more726iL YDOCSep 12, 2020Tried "IM" which is not a valid Roman numeral in the testcase console, and it says Expected: 999

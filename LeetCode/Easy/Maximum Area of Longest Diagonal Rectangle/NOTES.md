          Maximum Area of Longest Diagonal Rectangle

          - Summary: The code uses a 2D integer array to represent the dimensions of rectangles. It iterates through each rectangle, calculating the square of its diagonal using the Pythagorean theorem.  It then updates the maximum diagonal and corresponding area if a larger diagonal is found or if the diagonals are equal but the area is larger. Finally, it returns the maximum area found.

          - Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of rectangles. This is because the code iterates through the input array once.
          - Space Complexity: O(1). The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space to store variables like maxArea and maxDiag, regardless of the input size.
